#The Adventurers Wanted uses a strict ID system to make the system easier to author content for
#The IDs below 100 are core utility systems that are usually straight copies or modifications of how the AW system works, such as monsters being able to migrate and be defeated by adventurers.
#The IDs above 100 are more unique situations for the specific encounter, but they should correlate with the numbers from above: if ID 10s deal with migration, then ID 110s should be the unique events to do with migration - for example bribing a Thieves Guild to GTFO your country
#Crazy and more uniques ones that dont conform to the utilities should be ID 200

#USE THE anb_aw_spawner TO SEE A SIMPLE COPY-PASTABLE FORMAT IN ADDITION TO STUFF LIKE MIGRATION STYLES ETC
#Search for CHANGEABLE for the criteria you should change in that file and this one

# Welcome to the master file for the Adventurers Wanted System. In the comments below you'll see copy-pastable events for you to choose, different migration styles as well as prebuilt events to handle stuff like spawning rebellions
