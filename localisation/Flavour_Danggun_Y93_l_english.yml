 ### Events
 danggun.1.t:0 "The Trials of Sado"
 danggun.1.d:0 "The Sage King Manjang was the first to truly unite the entirety of Gowon under his rule, negotiating a lasting peace between man and spirit. In his quest to achieve this peace, he proved himself a fair and just ruler. His reputation as an impartial mediator who united the human tribes of Gowon behind his rule and his extraordinary magical prowess allowed him to achieve the grand feat he is still remembered for many centuries after his death.\n\n He travelled to Nakseseom, and negotiated the Compacts with the fox spirit queen Sado. Confirmed with a ritual marriage, these Compacts would from this point on serve as the foundation of law governing both the humans and spirits of Gowon.\n\nAfter his death, a tradition began where prospective rulers of Gowon would travel to Nakseseom to seek the hand of Sado in marriage. Those she deemed worthy receive her guidance, with some even rising to the exalted status of Sage King. Those not deemed worthy would find themselves sating Sado’s carnal desires with their liver, and return to a realm in which they only govern its human half.\n\nThe Compacts are a set of laws that give human rulers in Gowon the right to enforce their will on the spirits inhabiting the region. They have the right to, after fair adjudication, enforce punishment up to and including exorcism to the spirit population should they deem it worthy. Yet the Compacts are only truly binding as long as a human ruler is a Sage King. If they are not, the local spirits will usually administer their own affairs without human interference.\n\nAnd now, like it has been countless times before since Manjang’s fateful first journey, it is time for another pilgrimage to Nakseseom. [Root.Monarch.GetName] stands ready to face Sado’s judgment of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] worth in the hopes of joining her in most sacred matrimony. And thus, the entire realm waits with bated breath for tidings from Nakseseom."
 danggun.1.a:0 "A new Sage King Rises!"
 danggun.1.b:0 "To be sagely guided is a great thing indeed."

 danggun.2.t:0 "Death of a Sage King"
 danggun.2.d:0 "A most ferocious storm howls across the lands of [Root.GetName], born from the rattling last breath leaving the lips of [Root.Monarch.GetName]. It is a storm whose mournful howls and icy touch is felt by all inhabitants of [Root.GetName], be they human or spirit, for a Sage King has left this world.\n\nA profound sense of uncertainty has the realm in its grip, for until they are renewed once more, the Compacts of Manjang no longer bind the spirits of Gowon to mortal authority. No longer do humans and spirits bow to the same master, and disputes once decisively resolved, conflicts until now safely suppressed, might well rise to the surface once again, threatening the prosperity of the realm and the well-being of both the mortal and immortal denizens of [Root.GetName]. All that is left is the hope that a new Sage King will soon rise to meet Sado’s exacting standards and return the land to its lost harmonious order."
 danggun.2.a:0 "The people of Gowon, human and spirit alike, mourn this tragic loss."
