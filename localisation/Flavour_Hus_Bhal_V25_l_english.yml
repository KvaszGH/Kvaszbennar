 V25_staring_down_tsarai_title:0 "Staring Down Tsarai"
 V25_staring_down_tsarai_desc:0 "The Nuugdan Tsarai Bhaatum have always grasped for glory beyond their reach. During the chaos of the Daehonse period, they dared to ravage our lands in Zougzengom and profane the shrine where the mask of Altan the Old was kept since the time of the Husuusing.\n\nThe mask has been returned to its proper place by contrite former vassal clans of Nuugdan Tsarai, but a new overly ambitious Izhuun has arisen amongst the remainder of the Nuugdan Tsarai, declaring herself with overweening arrogance the ‘Faceless Queen’.\n\nWe shall not underestimate these people’s ambition and duplicity for a second time. It is time to squash them before they turn once more from a gnat into a venomous scorpion. Their lands, their herds, their kinfolk: all shall serve the greater glory of Hus Bhal!"

 V25_between_mountains_title:0 "Between Mountains"
 V25_between_mountains_desc:0 "Between the windswept peaks of the Baztaishaak mountains and the icy heights of the Lotus Peaks lie the vast desert vale of the Martsagaamjoolgin, once the beating heart of Khantaar civilisation and now only home to desolate ruins, voracious facestealers and our hardy nomadic cousins of the Rünsukhi.\n\nYet for all their obstinate tenacity, the effort required to carve out an existence in the wasteland left them with little to resist our hardy terror bird riders, once we turned our attention to the west. Now, with their lands part of our great bhaatum, it falls to us to bring them truly into the fold, turning their scattered clans into proud tribes, their leaders equal to those of the Yomod Rüsh in our heartlands to the east. Only this way can we ensure their lasting loyalty and secure our hold over the hidden riches of their desolate home."

 V25_howling_plateaus_title:0 "Howling Solitude"
 V25_howling_plateaus_desc:0 "High above the grand valley of the Martsagaamjoolgin, cold winds blow across the Hakuuruk plateau, an arid highland surrounded by steep mountains and accessible only by a handful of well-guarded mountain passes. It is here that the Rukunai have sought shelter in their monastery-cities ever since the Husuusing and the advent of the Facestealers in its wake.\n\nYet in their solitude they have mastered an array of esoteric spiritual techniques to combat hostile spirit entities, the Facestealers first among them. This esoteric knowledge could well be the key to win our struggle against the infestation plaguing these lands.\n\nOvercoming their isolationist predilections and convincing them to submit to our rule will not be an easily accomplished task, yet it is vital for us to do so. Once the high abbots and priors of their great monasteries have been convinced of the righteousness of our cause, the rest of the Rukunai under their protection will follow."

 V25_beating_heart_of_khantaar_title:0 "Beating Heart of Khantaar"
 V25_beating_heart_of_khantaar_desc:0 "Through determined effort and courageous sacrifice, we have pushed back the Facestealer scourge not just from the steppes of Shuvüüshudi, but the deserts and highland plateaus of Khaashalg. Together with our Rukunai and Rünsukhi cousins, once estranged but now an integral part of our Kaashegate, we have taken the first steps of truly reclaiming our common ancestral homeland. Under our firm but benevolent rule, the desiccated heart of Khantaar has begun to beat again.\n\nWe shall not rest until the Facestealers are dealt with once and for all, ending the curse that has plagued our ancestors for so long. And as we have seen, the wise monks residing in the Levaajan monasteries are crucial to said effort. Their devoted contemplations have brought them ever closer to the Supreme Spirit, and our hope to find a weapon against our unrelenting ancestral enemy lies with them. They shall therefore be honored as befits the noble deeds they have performed and the grand service they will continue to provide for all our people."

 V25_vanguards_and_adjudication_title:0 "Vanguards and Adjudicators"
 V25_vanguards_and_adjudication_desc:0 "We are the vanguard of the Shuvüüsh people. We shield all other clans from the implacable dread of the facestealers that spills out of the barren homeland of our distant ancestors. Without our stalwart vigilance, the voracious hunger of these creatures might long since have scoured the vast steppes, and even the fertile lands of the soft-bellied city dwellers beyond, of all life.\n\nIt falls to us to keep this unrelenting threat at bay, a sacred duty imposed upon us by the Shepherd of Souls and Altan, first of all Kaanergs. Yet with this harshest of duties comes the right to judge those who fail in their vigilance and thus endanger all. Our Adjudicators, those who don the white mask, traverse the vast steppes to sit in judgment over those who have failed to uphold the sacred traditions meant to protect them and their kin, while their black-masked counterparts roam the land in search of facestealer infestations to chase back into the desert wastes."

 V25_shrines_and_lakes_title:0 "Shrines of the Sacred Lake"
 V25_shrines_and_lakes_desc:0 "The waters of the Dakilbege Núk are hallowed to our people, a vast expanse of black water found at the heart of the parched white steppe. The shores of the lake are sacred ground to our shamans, a liminal space between life and death, solid ground and ever-flowing waves.\n\nIt is here where the white-masked adjudicators of our bhaatum receive their initiation in the mysteries of the spirit world. Here they learn to treat with spirits both small and large, from the smallest wind sprite to Dakil Huu, the spirit of the lake itself.\n\nGiven our rising fortunes, we are at long last in the position to fulfill our most noble duty, restoring the local shrines dotting the shores of the lake to their former glory.\n\nThis way, we can ensure that future generations of our clan will always have adjudicators ready to strike beneficial deals with the capricious spirits of our homeland. Let an army of adjudicators arise from the black waters and turn the might of the spirits against any enemies we might face."

 V25_to_merge_and_ideate_title:0 "A Merging of Traditions"
 V25_to_merge_and_ideate_desc:0 "No matter if we are Shuvüüsh, Rukunai or Rünsukhi, we all believe in the Supreme Spirit. How that faith is expressed might vary, given the divergent paths our people traversed after the fall of our Khantaar ancestors, but it remains a constant source of comfort for our people, and it binds us all together.\n\nWith all the many Rukunai monasteries now professing their fealty to us, we are afforded a unique opportunity: to bring together our traditions and those of our western cousins for one vitally important cause. It is time to uncover a final answer to the threat posed by the facestealers.\n\nBringing the ascetic monks of the Levajaan monasteries and their esoteric wisdom together with the sagacious insights of our adjudicators and death-priests will surely reveal the hidden mysteries of the spirit world; so equipped, we will bring an end to the menace that has caused such inconceivable suffering for countless generations."

 shuvuush.104.t:0 "To the Victor Go the Spoils"
 shuvuush.104.d:0 "Forlorn among the dusty soil and windswept grasses of the steppe lies a shattered mask, its bonewhite hue tainted by grime, its featureless elegance marred by dozens of cracks from the heavy step of a nameless terror bird’s talons.\n\nThis is the legacy of the vaunted Faceless Queen of Nuugdan Tsarai, all that remains of her ambitious goals and empty promises. Against all odds, her seemingly fated rise to preeminence was cut short on these empty plains. For it was the stalwart bravery of Hus Bhal and not the brash daring of Nuugdan Tsarai that carried the day.\n\nNow, the confederation of clans assembled beneath her banner is shattered, each one desperately seeking to curry favour with the Izhuun of Hus Bhal, eager to throw their neighbour to the wolves if it means they might survive this unexpected upheaval. The clans assembled beneath our righteous banner have grown fat from the spoils of victory, and their appetite for further and greater triumphs has been awakened.\n\nAll across Shuvüüshudi, the fierce winds carry the name Hus Bhal with them. And every other Izhuun lies awake at night, restlessly wondering if their bhaatum might be the next to fall to the might of Hus Bhal."
 shuvuush.104.a:0 "We shall not rest until all the steppes bow to one Kaasheg!"
 shuvuush.105.t:0 "The Merging of Practices"
 shuvuush.105.d:0 "Ever since the days of legend, when the three brothers saved our people from ruin and the Shepherd of Souls taught Tsagaan the hidden ways to repel the Facestealers, our shamans have devoted their lives to the safety and wellbeing of our people. The black-masked death-priests spend their entire existence protecting our people from these depredations, while their white-masked adjudicator brethren appease those spirits less inimical to mortal life.\n\nYet this path is not the only one walked by those who have reason to fear the strangers who come wearing a friend’s face. The esoteric orders of the Rukunai, from the diligent Disciples of the Door, the volatile Brothers of the Sealed Gaze to the courageous Order of the Golden Mask and many others, have developed their own methods to deter the infestation plaguing their homeland from devouring all what is left of the Rukunai and Rünsukhi.\n\nDeep within the monastic fortress-cities of the Rukunai, our most accomplished shamans have sat in seclusion with the abbots and masters of esoteric Khaaz mantras under the flickering light of yak butter lamps for months on end, attempting to find commonalities between our practices and thus uncovering deeper layers of meaning and puissance previously hidden from both sides.\n\nAnd at long last, they have succeeded! By coating a steel sword with juniper oil, painting puissant Khaaz mantras on it and setting it ablaze with conjured spirit fire, they have wrought a weapon that may not only deter but seriously harm or even slay a Facestealer. While it is by no means a technique easily reproduced without the required skills, it is a far more potent weapon than any we have had at our disposal until now."
