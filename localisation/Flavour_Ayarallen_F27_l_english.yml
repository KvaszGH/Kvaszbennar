 F27_odd_hunters_title:0 "Odd Hunters, Strange Prey"
 F27_odd_hunters_desc:0 "Ever since the days of the glorious mother Firanya, we have danced on the fields of war opposite the harpies of Hytiranyalen. Bitter outsiders who rejected the matriarch’s rule and fled into the hills of Bahar, we once felt their yoke of subjugation under the Third Queendom. Now, they feel our own.\n\nBut subjugation does not mean the destruction of their ways of life; even if they have rejected their guidance, we all remain children of Firanya. Still, appeasing our new subjects may prove difficult with our storied and adversarial history. In times like these, one cannot approach the issue head on; a new angle of attack is needed, and with unorthodox methods of feather and voice we may still win over Hytiranyalen yet."

 F27_under_the_wing_title:0 "Under The Wing"
 F27_under_the_wing_desc:0 "Some are wont to call our regard for our human subjects unique: this may be so, given our long intertwining, but it is not absolute. The humans of Bahar foster a profound hostility for the goblins who swept from the Serpentspine, and no lasting harpy peace can exist while this hatred festers. As in all things, the ruler of the skies grants earthly folk dominion over their places: the goblins will have their courts, and so will the humans. It will be difficult to truly resolve such a deeply felt feud, especially given that the old land claims are in living memory, but there can be no half measures in the establishment of a new Harpy queendom. Someday soon, humans and goblins will live peacefully together in Bahar."

 F27_city_of_knowledge_title:0 "City Of Knowledge"
 F27_city_of_knowledge_desc:0 "Throughout the many halls of scholarship that dot the lands of Bulwar, none are as grand as the temple-library of Eduz-Ginakku. Building on centuries of academics and theology, the Great Library of Aqatbar now stands as a shining beacon of learning and  knowledge, with many scholars travelling to Bahar for Eduz-Ginakku alone.\n\nThis thirst for knowledge extends to the Hytiranyalen, who view the temple complex with ravenous hunger. Now that we find ourselves on somewhat common ground, their curiosity has admittedly spread among our own people. What wondrous shards of the past could be hiding behind the temple city’s walls?"

 F27_raising_the_roosts_title:0 "Raising the Roosts"
 F27_raising_the_roosts_desc:0 "From the many tomes of Eduz-Ginakku we have acquired a colossal amount of new knowledge. Treatises on architecture, infrastructure, agriculture, and so much more have poured into the minds of Ayarallen’s top scholars, and with this new information we now see how easily our own settlements could be improved.\n\nHarpies have long considered the sky their domain, but at day’s end we must all return to the ground to roost. Developing the land has been seen as an afterthought, and our fields have gone fallow and our roads have been dilapidated as a result. No longer! We shall use all the techniques we have learned within the pages of Aqatbar, and make the people of Ayarallen the homes they deserve!"

 F27_raise_the_flocks_title:0 "Raise The Flocks"
 F27_raise_the_flocks_desc:0 "It is the fault of the parent if the children bicker, and above all our minor flocks have lacked purpose. Life, the matriarch wonders, must be about more than access to an aquifer. Lowlanders rarely understand the hidden pride of the matriarch, which can ignore the slander of outsiders but which takes extreme umbrage at the passing comment of a fellow harpy. Here in the sky we have perched among ourselves, and scratched ceaselessly at each other. No longer. Ayarallen will fly once more in formation, and our wings will blot out the sun."

 F27_royal_blood_title:0 "Of Royal Blood"
 F27_royal_blood_desc:0 "The fractious and warlike harpies of Nansalen draw their consorts by long tradition from the people of Akalšes, stymied only by contested dominion over the region and by the hostility of its elven rulers. We have made a claim to real hegemony over the harpies, and we more than most know that a Matriarch demands proof of the value of an exchange before she accedes to it. Let us bind the Nansalen to us by the greatest of debts - that of the village matchmaker. Nansalen shall have their husbands, and we shall have their loyalty."

 F27_soft_words_and_sweet_promises_title:0 "Soft Words, Sweet Promises"
 F27_soft_words_and_sweet_promises_desc:0 "Harpies have always drawn a negative image in the eyes of the other races of Bulwar. Raiders stealing their men, looting their villages, and slaying their warriors are just a few of the many poor depictions of our kind as we push to expand into the modern day. While the times when these were necessary still stain our history, we now have a strength that we didn’t before, and with it a tool to repair our reputation in the surrounding lands - diplomacy. On wings of cooperation, not conquest, we shall prove to those around us that we are no longer beings of spear and talon. Instead, through our resplendent Emissaries, we have morphed into masters of quill and paper."

 F27_looking_out_title:0 "Looking Out"
 F27_looking_out_desc:0 "We are people of the open sky, who nest by the mountains. Projecting power east over the Serpentspine is a pointless endeavour that would land us in neverending conflict with the Centaurs while stranding us far from home. The Serpentspine’s caves promise only claustrophobic misery and yet more death. Even the forests of the north offer only a sea of endless green in which to drown. No, these places are best appeased, by the greatest harpy diplomacy we can bring to bear. Goods, services, people, ideas; we will open to them all, and in doing so render ourselves all the richer."

 F27_stewardess_of_the_suran_title:0 "Stewardess Of The Suran"
 F27_stewardess_of_the_suran_desc:0 "For every harvest scratched from the soil of the great Bulwari rivers, enough blood is spilled to replenish it twofold. We soar to power no less eagerly than the hundreds of other despots who have claimed these lands, and yet rulership is an art, practised differently from one craftsman to another. From now onwards, as long as we rule, let the blood run out with the silt; let it diffuse into the Divenhal. The scholars will write that to the greatest of temples, the rule of the harpies brought rest."

 F27_queen_of_the_hills_title:0 "Queen Of The Hills"
 F27_queen_of_the_hills_desc:0 "To take flight without a solid nest is madness: a simple wisdom to which we harpies more easily agree than adhere, so used as we are to our endless peregrinations. It is difficult to keep a bevy of matriarchs together and focused on a single goal, let alone over generations, and so what we have built in these highlands is all the more remarkable. Our roosts are peaceful and functional, unburdened by the internecine conflict of daughters, our discourse in the perch of the queen respectful and productive. Our talons are sharp and pointed where they should be; towards wider Bulwar, and the destiny of Ayarallen."

 F27_bring_the_shade_title:0 "Bring The Shade"
 F27_bring_the_shade_desc:0 "Until now, we have been a claimant, one of many with ambitions to reunify Bulwar for the umpteenth time in its venerable history. Such claimants must prove their right to every inch of territory, and our envoys have flocked to every court from the Dameshead to Rahen, dissembling our ambition while quietly proving our mettle. We tiptoe no longer. Serpentspine to Divenhal, all Bulwar is in the shadow of harpy wings. What remains is simply to subjugate the river cities, making our will manifest."

 F27_plight_of_the_sadnatu_title:0 "The Plight Of The Sadnatu"
 F27_plight_of_the_sadnatu_desc:0 "They will say of the harpies that we came at a time of blood, and stopped the flow. We have long noted with alarm the dire situation of the Šadnatu, trapped in constant struggle for independence from the gnolls, and yet the long register of Bulwari history shows us what will happen, should we intervene and allow them their revenge. Quite apart from concerns of mercy, such a revenge will breed only further unrest, and a neverending casus belli against us. These are our terms: the humans of Šad Sur will have their independence, peace and freedom. And there, with their hands on their sword hilts, we will all finally stop. The gnolls will abandon their sacrifice, and both sides will respect the rule of the harpy queens."

 F27_fourth_and_final_title:0 "Fourth And Final"
 F27_fourth_and_final_desc:0 "If there is a great mistake of harpy rule, it is an extension of our long history of elite consultation; matriarchs feel free to speak back to the Queen in the safety of the council, and every harpy of any renown maintains their own magisterial air. Such able satraps readily envision themselves as independent rulers. If we seek to maintain this grand harpy confederation we have built, we must establish a Queen among Queens, a court of grandeur, the authority and majesty of which are final and unquestionable."

 F27_plight_of_the_rebellion_title:0 "Plight Of The Rebellion"
 F27_plight_of_the_rebellion_desc:0 "We harpies have been called deceitful, conniving, underhanded: the truth is that a Harpy Queen sees in every stranger their newest ally, and will dive over collapsing fences of propriety to make it so. Dartaxes and his rebellion of the old believers constitute one such potential ally, and a grateful one at that. They are a militarised populace brimming with resentment, who look upon our Gelkari envoys with far more friendship than the Sun Elves. We do not begrudge them their ancient faith or its practice, and we share enemies. For starters, that may well be enough."

 F27_baharkhand_reborn_title:0 "Baharkand Reborn"
 F27_baharkhand_reborn_desc:0 "The exchange of spouses has been achieved; a harpy messenger may now travel unaccosted along the entire width of Bulwar. The smiles shared between our people and the old cultists are still tentative, but we are fellow outcasts in the eyes of the great elven kingdoms and have much bringing us together. Let the western wing unfurl - siblings-in-law will soon give way to cousins, a great imperial family of northern Bulwar. As in a courtship dance, such things need not be rushed."

 F27_change_in_custody_title:0 "A Change In Custody"
 F27_change_in_custody_desc:0 "As we move across the lands of Bulwar, one point in particular has become of interest to our kind - Eduz-Vacyn and its ancient temple, Eduz-Hammura. This towering ziggurat stands high above all other structures in the city, holding a small crystal which scatters the dawn’s light across the walls.\n\nWith our conquest of the region, Eduz-Hammura now belongs to us, and with it a monument of great significance. The heights of the temple connect harpykind to the sky, and our songs now ring out from its peak and echo down into the city below. But this city has a history as old as the land itself, and the followers of Surael deserve to have this history respected as our twin cultures come together. Together, we shall find a way for us all to roost together in camaraderie, with followers of all kinds basking in the sun."

 F27_bulwari_metropol_title:0 "Bulwari Metropol"
 F27_bulwari_metropol_desc:0 "We have flown far and wide across Bulwar, bringing many different lands and peoples underneath our wings. But now, as we realize the dawn of a new era for Bulwar, a novel task falls upon us - proving that we may serve as the stewards of the Garden and bring prosperity to all within our lands. Where once the people of the Garden languished under the yoke of their oppressors, in our care they stand together as one flock.\n\nSkyward structures will rise from the hills, products of harpy, human and elven hands alike. Bustling cities in hills and deserts shall become melting pots of cultures and races, splendid in their diversity. With time, effort, and the resources we have obtained, we shall take up our role in earnest and make Bulwar flourish and shine like never before!"

 F27_raiders_of_earth_title:0 "Raiders Of The Earth"
 F27_raiders_of_earth_desc:0 "Since time immemorial our eponymous hills have hidden great reserves of wealth, and we, the great roamers of Halann, have sought them. Few queens go without marking their own quarry, and the resources they claim simply fuel further jaunts. It is the nature of our people to be restless, however, and we know there is yet more wealth to be found in our homeland. Our talons will rake the soil a hundredth time, and from its depths bring forth brilliant things."

 F27_harpyway_title:0 "The Harpyway"
 F27_harpyway_desc:0 "Since the opening of the archives of Aqatbar, the Hytiranyalen have delved eagerly and deeply into its reserves of knowledge, more and more of their senior matriarchs taking up permanent residence in spires close to the library itself. From such hallowed halls flow new ideas of governance and statecraft, new standards, new imperatives. The matriarchs are arguing that no true Harpy governance can flourish without a network of rest towers, without proper roads for our human freight caravans, without the adoption of standard weights and measures. No longer will the harpy lands be Bulwar’s backwater; from the Serpentspine to the Divenhal, the Queen’s peace will guarantee wealth."

 F27_humans_hills_title:0 "Humans Of The Hills"
 F27_humans_hills_desc:0 "Where we harpies move, humans stand. Where we speak, they fall silent. Our nature renders us natural interlocutors, the go-betweens of a hundred peoples, and yet even with our closest neighbours we struggle to find concord. The famed tenacity of these shepherds has long frustrated harpy ambition, but the terror raid has never cowed the Gelkari, merely embittered them. We are the ones who can fly and so we must be the ones to go to them. We must meet them where they are or they will never accept us. Let us make peace and hand them the tools to defend their hilltop towns forever. In so doing, we turn a new page and begin to write a story of alliance, not animosity."

flavour_ayarallen.1.t: "The Plight of the Sadnatu"
flavour_ayarallen.1.d: "The Šadnatu have for too long been in a state of constant conflict and subjugation under the Sandfang. While initially we presumed it might be a simple affair to keep the oppressor and the oppressed separated, even peaceful, already furious petitioners from even far-off human townships climb the roost to petition the Matriarch, their senseless, rage-driven demands drowning out more sensible solutions in the Matriarch's hall.\n\nThe Gnolls, those who at the very least respect our power and authority, offer tribute - gold and slaves - in return for respecting their control in the region, both over the land and the Humans within.\n\nOur wings have covered many, and under their shade, our people and vassals have thrived. Peace and prosperity are greeting all who submit. Oh, there is grumbling, of course, but eventually, all realize it is easier to be in service to the nest than against it.\n\nGnolls, however, have little care for most things; their culture predisposes them towards subservience, but seemingly nothing can stop their bloodlust and propensity towards sacrifice and violence.\n\nThe Gnolls have long worshipped demons, foul beings with fouler ideas that have driven the Gnolls to conquer and sacrifice for generations, bringing them and their opponents to ruin again and again in long, self-destructive wars.\n\nThe Humans, though without the same troublesome beliefs, are almost as violent, and if given the chance, would surely take out their anger on their former oppressors. They are not well known for restraint in… delicate situations.\n\nNow, as we attempt to integrate the Gnolls and return lands to the Humans, both sides endlessly jockey for power, control, and even blood.\n\nIf we were to do nothing, it would not be long before yet another large-scale conflict would break out, and the endless cycle of generational slaughter would begin once more. Usually, we grant our territories autonomy, with some concessions, of course.\n\nBut this?\n\nFor both the long-suffering Humans and for the overall peace of the region, we must take them under our wings, directly.\n\nIn our shade, the Humans will have peace, their lands, and safety, and the Gnolls will learn a new, better way.\n\nOur way."

flavour_ayarallen.3.d: "A northerly wind battered against Heunthume’s flank - most unusual. It blew towards the Twin Rivers, and all present smiled at the omen.\n\nTeisi spilled over their stool, huffing and puffing as they rearranged documents. They had already been forced to slam their palm down hard on a flyaway document or two. "We prefer to fly in a month or two, once sufficient livestock can be-"\n\n[F80.Monarch.GetName] scoffed.

It was, contrary to appearances, a promising sign. They were all independently motivated, and all saw profit in the venture.

flavour_ayarallen.4.t: "The Queendom’s Claim"
flavour_ayarallen.4.d: ""For those who already rule, it is convenient to deem ambition an unworthy prerequisite for power."\n\nThe chamber tittered in approval at the matriarch’s words, that infamous omen of harpy hostility. Here in Heunthume one generally heard no anger, only tittering disdain - the laughter behind the wing. Enarios felt no fear, however. He was valuable to the Queen for his honesty.\n\n"Your Grace, it is a question of legitimacy. Of whether one can keep what one conquers. Of whether it will be allowed to remain so." He had the privilege of sitting rather than standing in his queen’s presence, though since he had reached three hundred and fifty, this was more necessity than luxury. His legs were stiff and aching, and he rarely left the royal compound. He shifted, and the thick blanket on his lap slipped from one of his legs. One of the Queen’s maids rushed to replace it, and he smiled in thanks.\n\n"We believe that is no longer relevant, given our strength and breadth," replied the Queen. Their expression was severe. "And we believe there are costs to humility."\n\nEnarios conceded this with a nod. "Then forgive me the impertinence of a warning."\n"Always."\n"You must take no half-measures. Even if, for the moment, you look only upon a city or two, you must claim the whole prize. You cannot prove your sovereignty over Bulwar before you have shown the requisite arrogance to claim it." He paused for a sip of water, the unequalled crystal tang of the Harpy Hills.\n\n"Above all else, my people are too proud to be ruled by the humble.""

flavour_ayarallen.6.d: "Although different in size, scope, and power, the essence of all queendoms in the history of Bulwar stems from the same source. Many think this source to be the sky, as we dance freely among the clouds and soar above their heads. But the sky cannot be claimed by one queendom, for all harpies share in the freedom to fly wherever they choose; the sky can never be shackled, for that would mean to shackle all harpykind.\n\nInstead, queendoms draw their spirit from the earth, and the people who live and work below our wings: the humans, elves, and other species who have come together and built the lands of Bulwar into something that may be enjoyed by all, a garden of knowledge and prosperity shining in the night. Through hard work and mutual trust, we have come together with these people and formed a truly beautiful state, where all within may enjoy the fruits of the garden.\n\nOur mastery of the realm has surpassed the idea of harpies as disparate raiders, sacking the land and leaving the people behind to suffer. We are now wardens, custodians, and caretakers, bringing Bulwar under our wing and guiding it forward. In taking flight towards a new age, harpies have defined themselves as guardians of the land and its people, and as such together we decree a new name: Harpylen, the Fourth Queendom, and the rightful stewards of Bulwar. The world shall know our radiance, and our people will bask in the light of our glory!"

They had travelled in leisurely laziness south across the peaks, feasting and partying, all the better to hide their purpose.\n\nIt was imperative to play it casual, to wander across the tier and suggest - what fun! - that they duck in on the Queen in the royal chambers. Only thus could they shake their entourage and free their lady’s maids of any future accusation. They landed lightly on the Queen’s windowperch, and sidled into the study with the insouciance of youth.\n\n“Tehanna,” said the Queen, indulgently waving them onto a chaise. “You’ve escaped your suitors.”\n\n“Oh, they’re no Bakhdasars,” Tehanna said - he was said to have grown wings in pursuit of his harpy lover. “I think they just fancied a holiday.” The young harpy had spread themself over the cushions and was inspecting a small plate of Gelkari sheep’s cheese.\n\n“Your friend is doing well,” said the Queen, replacing her pen on its inkstand. “I’ve put him in the chancellery for now; you can take him back with you if necessary.”\n\nTehanna smiled. “No no, I fear he’s no longer welcome in Firanyalen. Hotter heads are prevailing there.”\n\nThe Queen nodded. “How hot?”\n\n“My half-sister regards themself as a modern Atyaneh. Atyaneh, of course, only attacked elves, but the general southward thrust, you know…” Tehanna waved a hand. \n\n“I do,” said the Queen, and cleared their throat. “Tehanna, have you ever heard of a speaking stone?

In the lakelands they did not make the grand hairpieces so beloved of fashionable courts, but the envoy’s face had been painted empty white, the mourning face. \n\n“Are those rubies?” This was an auntie on a small pouffe, leaning towards their neighbour.\n“You were expecting subtlety?” The two dissolved into laughter, until a twitch of the Queen’s wing silenced them.\n\nThere was no dance, no great performance. That had been done outside. The envoy, weighed down by tears soon to be shed, climbed from the very lowest tier of Heunthume, announcing their intent. Once at the palace, nothing more was to be said. The envoy simply approached the throne, and passed over the declaration. The daughters of Firanyalen had rejected the Queen’s peace, definitively and forever.\n\n“My sister grieves me.” [Root.Monarch.GetName] was expressionless. The envoy’s blank white face stared back. “I have received you, auntie.”\n\nThe envoy finally nodded. They stepped back, moving out towards an antechamber.

There were no bars or tethers between them and freedom; only the knowledge that a harpy outlaw could never truly land again. The queens moved their pieces across the great Bulwari board with ruthless calculation, but it was only right to concede when one’s game was finished. What would it say if the last independent Firanyaleni matriarch fled like some scrub vole?\n\n“Sisters are sisters.”\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] nodded slowly, their folded wings twitching slightly in agitation. They wished for a breeze, some stimulus that would offer them a pause, but the whole complex was silent. As in any respectable harpy household, the servants had left the spire for the night.\n\n“You’re wondering if I’m more dangerous than demonstrative if left alive,” the matriarch said, and [Root.Monarch.GetName] gestured to concede this. “Well. One doesn’t give an enemy advice.”\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] laughed. “We’ve always been competitive.”\n\n“Yes,” said the matriarch, combing out their hair as if they were chatting with a lady’s maid. “Don’t think I forget that you usually won.”\n\n“I did,” replied [Root.Monarch.GetName].
