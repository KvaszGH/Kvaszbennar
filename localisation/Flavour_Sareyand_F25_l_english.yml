 sareyand_patronage_of_the_landlords_title:0 "Patronage of the Landlords"
 sareyand_patronage_of_the_landlords_desc:0 "Our lands are dotted with the massive estates of our Sun Elven brethren. It is those landlords that are the foundation of our rule and it is with their support that we can gain and maintain our greatness."

 sareyand_rebuild_the_ash_palace_title:0 "Rebuild the Ash Palace"
 sareyand_rebuild_the_ash_palace_desc:0 "Since the palace of Sareyand was burned down during Jexis' youth its husk has sat there like a great carcass, black and empty. It is time we restore this relic of Jaher's days to its former glory, and possibly even embellish it further. That will show we truly are the worthy successors of the great conqueror."

 sareyand_artists_of_triumph_title:0 "Artists of Triumph"
 sareyand_artists_of_triumph_desc:0 "The Gallery of War is a great asset to our nation, but its paintings depict battles from centuries past. And while those battles are inspiring, their recollections are not accurate. The best way to fill the Gallery with our victories is by having artists accompany our armies and document their exploits directly. They will be known as Artists of Triumph and Sorrow, and it is their charcoal, brush and paint, that shall record our future!"

 sareyand_sunshine_manors_title:0 "Sunshine Manors"
 sareyand_sunshine_manors_desc:0 "The manors of the landlords are the motor of our economy. Their massive farm estates provide the taxes and the resources that maintain our politics, infrastructure and army. So naturally more developed estates mean more money."

 sareyand_the_sad_sur_title:0 "The Šad Sur"
 sareyand_the_sad_sur_desc:0 "The Mountains of the Sun have been infested with gnolls since time immemorial. It was the outpost of many gnoll raids during Jaher's time and still under his successors. Furthermore, they guard the western approach of Bulwar from the Salahad. The construction of a great fort there will be exactly the protection we need against new gnollish incursions. Let us bring them under our rule and ensure that such a thing never happens again."

 sareyand_the_length_of_the_suran_title:0 "The Length of the Suran"
 sareyand_the_length_of_the_suran_desc:0 "The Suran is the lifeblood of Bulwar, it flows from beyond Azka-Sur to Sareyand, Bulwar and all the way down to Brasan. Obviously, its importance to region cannot be overstated. And so, we should control it, from the source all the way down to the lands where in mythical times the Djinn were first broken."

 sareyand_recover_the_suran_plain_title:0 "Recover the Suran Plain"
 sareyand_recover_the_suran_plain_desc:0 "Zokka was a great adversary and the monster dealt us many defeats. But his life is short while we live long and it is time for us to reclaim what we have lost so that all can be well again."

 sareyand_sun_elven_protection_title:0 "Sun Elven Protection"
 sareyand_sun_elven_protection_desc:0 "It is our role and duty to protect the world against the Malevolent Dark. And so, it is our obligation to take those weaker than us under our wing, even if they don't know that they need the protection."

 sareyand_retribution_reclamation_title:0 "Retribution Reclamation"
 sareyand_retribution_reclamation_desc:0 ""

 sareyand_the_heart_of_bulwar_title:0 "The Heart of Bulwar"
 sareyand_the_heart_of_bulwar_desc:0 "Bulwar is a land of city-states and a land of city-states is at its heart. Independently they have stood for centuries, only united under the greatest conquerors. We should step into the footsteps of Jaher and Jexis and unite the city-states of Bulwar under our rule."

 sareyand_the_true_lords_of_bulwar_title:0 "True Lords of Bulwar"
 sareyand_the_true_lords_of_bulwar_desc:0 "Many peoples have disputed who are the lords of Bulwar. There have been human priests and kings, harpy matriarchs and gnollish warlords. But since the Landing it has been clear that elves are the true lords of this land and we will prove that time and again."

 sareyand_restore_azka_sur_title:0 "Restore Azka-Sur"
 sareyand_restore_azka_sur_desc:0 "Azka-Sur was once one of the major Kingdoms of Bulwar, but under repeated onslaught from gnollish attacks it lost both its land and its sun elven rulership. It is time we take responsibility and reestablish the Kingdom to its former glory. This time under better leadership."

 sareyand_no_more_gnolls_title:0 "No More Gnolls"
 sareyand_no_more_gnolls_desc:0 "We have pushed Zokka's pack back, but that is not enough. We can't rest until any gnoll remains to threaten our homes. We will start by pushing them out of the deserts of Bulwar."

 sareyand_the_rogue_legion_title:0 "The Rogue Legion"
 sareyand_the_rogue_legion_desc:0 "Since their return from Haless the old phoenix legions have gone rogue and become an unbridled horde with no civilisation or structure. Now they even went astray in their faith. We must bring these warriors back to the right path so that they can be a support to the cause instead of a threat."

 sareyand_the_shining_monastery_title:0 "The Shining Monastery"
 sareyand_the_shining_monastery_desc:0 "The monks of the Blazing Sun have been a great support in our campaigns and in our administration. It is time we give them a home where they can practise their work. It will be a library, school and barrack for all those wishing to pursue their special art."

 sareyand_build_the_blazing_temple_title:0 "Build the Blazing Temple"
 sareyand_build_the_blazing_temple_desc:0 "While the Shining Monastery serves a great purpose within our country, its residents have been talking about the need for a larger religious structure that is not just for them. We will heed their words and the Blazing Temple will arise next to their complex. This great structure shall honour Surael and surely will impress the gullible masses."

 sareyand_ashes_to_iron_title:0 "Ashes to Iron"
 sareyand_ashes_to_iron_desc:0 "We have resumed the attack, but attacking on its own won't let us gain the heights of a Phoenix. We must harden our armies and beat them into shape. Our Ash Legion will be a blade of the strongest steel to cut down our enemies."
 
 sareyand_iron_to_ashes_title:0 "Iron to Ashes"
 sareyand_iron_to_ashes_desc:0 ""

 sareyand_the_great_ash_legion_title:0 "The Great Ash Legion"
 sareyand_the_great_ash_legion_desc:0 "Too long have we relied on human auxiliaries and legionaries to fuel our war machine. They are good only for support. It is the elves that conquered Bulwar and Haless and so the Ash Legion must also be an elven legion at the core. We now finally have the numbers once more to make this vision a reality."

At the heart of the complex lies the Phoenix Citadel, surrounded by multiple fortification levels and civilian buildings supporting the local garrison. The Bulwark of the Sun, as it has become known, represents an insurmountable obstacle for all enemies attempting to reach the fertile plains of the Suran."

 city_of_ideas_brasan_upgrade:0 "The Entrepot of Bulwar"
 desc_city_of_ideas_brasan_upgrade:0 "Brasan is the greatest trading city in Bulwar and perhaps all of the Divenhal Sea. Merchants from southern Cannor and northern Sarhal congregate here and mingle with the merchants of Bulwar, creating an atmosphere of exchange both mercantile and intellectual. Of particular note is the city's connection to the Cannorian city of Port Jaher. The two cities are somewhat sisters, with many merchants having residences in both. This means that new ideas that spread to one city quickly spread to the other."
 city_of_ideas_sareyand_upgrade:0 "The Bazaar at Sareyand"
 desc_city_of_ideas_sareyand_upgrade:0 "Sareyand is the first stop in Bulwar for Raheni merchants, acting as a clearinghouse for goods that are carried further into Bulwar by native Bulwari traders. During the height of the market season, the city becomes an ocean of people, with great tent cities built outside to handle the incoming merchants and their goods. Such a great mass of weary and wealthy travelers attracts mongers and performers in the same manner as a smaller market, turning the meeting of merchants into something like a festival. Within this atmosphere, ideas flow as freely as coin and drink, giving Bulwar any new insights from the Raheni caravanserai city of Davharral and giving the merchants of Rahen new ideas to carry back to that city on the return trip."

 desc_bulwar_bulwar_temple_modifier_sareyand_upgrade:0 "A massive temple in the heart of the city, between the Suran and Buranun rivers and close to the famous canals that link them. Built by the Phoenix Emperor Jaher, the temple lies on a small ziggurat surrounded by gardens and canals. A massive polished brass phoenix, a gift from the dwarves of Seghdihr, guards the entrance of the complex.\n"

Eduz-Hammura rises above the city buildings, built on top of the tallest ziggurat still standing on Bulwar. On the platform on the side of the temple stands a small tower, which holds a crystal sphere, a gift from the Citrine Dwarves to their Surani friends. Every dawn when the Light of Surael touches the sphere, it is refracted into beams of colored light.\n"

During the disintegration of the Phoenix Empire the elven population of the city increased, making the Confluence Temple the only one where the higher positions of the clergy are held by elves.\n"
