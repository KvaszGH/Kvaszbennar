 S50_blessed_wardens_desc:0 "Blessed Elder,\n\nAllow us, your loyal Semayebaka, to rally the troops. It is not just a physical foe we face, but a spiritual one as well, and every soldier must be instilled with a sense of duty to Amilak. Only then can we prevail against trolls, hags, and Yrilak himself.\n\nYours faithfully,\nSemayebaka Enik Tariku"

 S50_contain_the_shadows_desc:0 "Marshal,\n\nThe men are ready and eager. You will find attached plans to push north, striking down Simegasa before they can bend or break under the trollish assault. Then, we intend to make for the edge of the cursed swamp and seal it off with new fortifications,  halting any major incursions the trolls may attempt.\n\nGeneral Sanzon zor Sabiku "

 S50_new_weather_patterns_title:0 "New Weather Patterns"
 S50_new_weather_patterns_desc:0 "Dearest Elder Warden,\n\nIt is my lot to inform you of the struggles my colleagues and I are facing in the manipulation of meteorological phenomena. All the old techniques, rituals, and rules-of-thumb are failing us. The weather plays by different rules here than it does in Madriamilak. As such, we require significant state investment to develop new approaches. A financial injection will be needed, of course, but my fellow scholars of magic would also like to be relieved of some religious duties. I’m sure you understand this scholarly work requires most of our time, and I believe even mighty Amilak will forgive the lapse.\n\nRespectfully,\nOwe zor Akau"

 S50_embed_the_mage_wardens_title:0 "Embed the Mage-Wardens"
 S50_embed_the_mage_wardens_desc:0 "Dearest Elder Warden,\n\nMany long years ago, I requested the state’s aid in the advancement of the weather arts. Since then, we have made great strides in developing new ways of moulding and directing the instruments of Amilak through the skies. Now, the time has come to fully reap the rewards of our hard work. By building a network of towers across the land, each mirroring the great Cloudfall Tower, and staffing them with mages and workmen, we can not only push agricultural output to new heights, but also employ terraforming magic to bend the very land to our desires. I need not tell you what a boon this will be to the development of the nation.\n\nRespectfully,\nOwe zor Akau"

 S50_fruits_of_our_labour_title:0 "Fruits of Our Labour"
 S50_fruits_of_our_labour_desc:0 "Honoured Elder Warden,\n\nI bring bountiful good news from the fields and groves. We are positively drowning in Moonrice and Lotunga timber. The cultivation of these staples has been - dare I say - perfected; no more unexplained diseases, no more mishaps with the water temperatures. We’re also doing great with the more niche flora, such as the Nightblossom and Hattiatia. And the fungal wines this year are excellent! A few bottles should arrive with this missive. All that’s left is for the council to fund agricultural ventures across the realm. \n\nYours always,\nHeyle zor Tafari, Botanist-Merchant"

 S50_overture_to_redemption_title:0 "Overture to Redemption"
 S50_overture_to_redemption_desc:0 "Dear Elder Warden,\n\nThe actions of the tyrant Tamrat have isolated our nation; our former friends fear and despise us. We must now work hard to earn forgiveness. Allow me to head a delegation to the Tanizu tribes; I have old friends there who will be willing to hear me out. If we can convince them that Yemotaferi is turning over a new leaf, they may start to trust us once more. Then, we can work on freeing them from the yoke of Kidsit Yiti.\n\nYours faithfully,\nLishan Berileb"

 S50_destroy_the_hag_lovers_title:0 "Destroy the Hag-Lovers"
 S50_destroy_the_hag_lovers_desc:0 "Marshal,\n\nA second draft of deployment orders requires your attention. As long as there are hag-servants to our east, we cannot fully devote ourselves to the containment of the swamp. Thus, I propose we also strike at Mukis, whose leadership is in bed with the hags. We will show no mercy to those who make deals with the crones, nor those who study their dark arts deep in the jungles. I expect Mukis’ other neighbours will thank us for putting an end to that vile realm.\n\nGeneral Sanzon zor Sabiku"

 S50_take_a_mile_title:0 "Take a Mile"
 S50_take_a_mile_desc:0 "...the time for cautious defence is over! If we sit in our castles forever, the hags will simply bleed us dry over time. We must take the fight to them, into the swamp! Lead us on this glorious path, oh Elder. With you at the front and Amilak at our side, we cannot lose.\n\nYour most ardent supporter,\nBonsa zor Ajan"

 S50_cloudfall_tower_title:0 "Cloudfall Tower"
 S50_cloudfall_tower_desc:0 "Great Elder,\n\nToday, I present to you plans for a grand edifice that will bring glory to Amilak and prosperity to the land we seek to make our home. The ruins of Hawatli Wizti Tali would be an excellent spot to turn into the primary residence of our priests and mages. We should restore the ancient statue of Amilak, symbolising our continued conquest of the swamp. Next to it, I propose erecting a grand tower, from which our mages may direct the gifts of heaven.\n\nPlease examine the enclosed sketches I have commissioned from the finest architects of the realm.\n\nGlory to Amilak,\nMenas zor Ayufar"

 S50_scholars_of_sky_and_shadow_desc:0 "Dear Council Elder,\n\nI’ve been surveying our newly acquired territories, investigating the plant life, terrain, and animals. I’ve concluded that life here will be hard. Most of the crops we cultivate beyond the swamp will not thrive here, and the native flora still holds many mysteries. With your support, I will organise studies into these matters. We will study the wonders of the Shadow Swamp, as well as search abroad for foreign crops that may flourish here. Knowledge will be the foundation of our future.\n\nYours kindly,\nEdna Ro"

 S50_surround_the_coven_title:0 "Surround the Coven"
 S50_surround_the_coven_desc:0 "Glory to you, Marshal\n\nOur advance into the swamp is like an unstoppable avalanche. Further and further we push, banishing the trolls back into the depths of the dark. We should now make sure that there is no escape for them, fortifying our borderlands to keep them contained. Likewise, we should seize all entrances to the swamp, so no outside forces can interfere. Soon, war will turn to massacre, and the world will be rid of trollkind.\n\nGlory to Yemotaferi,\nGeneral Afwerk zor Ezana"

 S50_purge_with_prejudice_title:0 "Purge with Prejudice"
 S50_purge_with_prejudice_desc:0 "Glory to you, Marshal\n\nOur triumph is complete. The Coven is no more, and the trolls are no longer a tribe or warband, just a pack of wild animals that we shall exterminate. With your leave, I shall organise a great hunt for every troll that still dwells within our borders. Before long, only humans will remain in this swamp. \n\nGlory to Yemotaferi,\nGeneral Afwerk zor Ezana"

 S50_integrate_the_echenka_title:0 "Integrate the Echenka"
 S50_integrate_the_echenka_desc:0 "Gracious Chief of the Wardens,\n\nOur lands are falling to your blades. You have driven out the sorceresses who claimed dominion over us and now you are wielding fire and death against their former servants. The trolls’ only fate is death in your eyes, and rightly so. But I must appeal to your mercy and implore that you do not let the same fate befall my people, the Echenka. We are not monsters, but humans, the same as you. Many of us have lived in the swamp for countless generations, and we wish to stay here in our home. We can live together here, with you, as a community that takes care of the swamp.\n\nHumbly yours,\nKricirr ‘the Strong’"

 S50_hunt_the_warlocks_title:0 "Hunt the Warlocks"
 S50_hunt_the_warlocks_desc:0 "Gracious Chief of the Wardens,\n\nYou have done my people a great service by choosing conciliation. Now, I urge you to pursue that policy further. The gnolls of Rakkaz are largely victims of their warlocks, power-mad villains who trade the lives and souls of their kin to please the hags and demons they pact with. Set us on a path to eradicate these wretches, so that the gnolls may be brought into the League of Light.\n\nProudly yours,\nKricirr ‘the Strong’"

 S50_sanctioned_shadow_cults_title:0 "Sanctioned Shadow Cults"
 S50_sanctioned_shadow_cults_desc:0 "Fellow Devotee of the Darkness,\n\nMany years ago, your people feared the shadows, while we had learned long ago that they are an important part of the world. Now, you have made the swamp your home and are growing familiar with its ways. Grant us then the freedom to worship according to the custom of our ancestors. We hold no love for evil spirits; you may persecute those as you wish. Some shadows arise from nought but evil and threaten all they touch, while others are but the consequence of an illuminating light. The key to life in the darkness is distinguishing between the two. Since you have learned to revere the Shadowroot, who is a creature of shadows herself, these words must resonate with you, I trust.\n\nYours in shadow,\nAnanto ‘the Dead’"

 S50_let_there_be_light_title:0 "Let There Be Light"
 S50_let_there_be_light_desc:0 "Dear Elder Warden,\n\nThe dreary lands we call home are devoid of colour and cast in shadow. But we are the children of Amilak, and his devout can call upon the light of the heavens. I propose we hold a great prayer to the Lord of the Heavens, beseeching him to light up our lands and instil us with confidence. We shall need it going forward.\n\nYours faithfully,\nKajen zor Werknesh"

 S50_ten_thousand_troll_heads_title:0 "Ten Thousand Troll Heads"
 S50_ten_thousand_troll_heads_desc:0 "Greetings, Elder Warden,\n\nOnce, we were allies, until your mad king dragged us into his foolish war. Now, you approach us seeking forgiveness and a path forward. We will be frank and admit that we would welcome a return to a time before the madness, the suffering. But such a thing is not so easily achieved. As much as we chafe under Kidsit Yiti, we need to know we are not heading into a second disaster. Your realm is not what it once was, and you are already under serious threat from the trolls. If you are truly committed to righting wrongs and redeeming your nation, we require a show of commitment and strength. If you can show us the heads of ten thousand trolls, we may yet dare to join your side once more.\n\nRegards,\nIgiaruza Agayonga"

 S50_comit_to_the_darkness_title:0 "Comit to the Darkness"
 S50_comit_to_the_darkness_desc:0 "Save us, honoured Elder-Warden.\nThey bleed us pale to fuel their hate.\nCome find us where the groves are hueless\nMake haste, my sage, the hour is late.\n\nFor me, it is this verse, repeated in my dreams for days. For others, the words differ, or they merely hear screams. Some see a woman in chains, some a tree being felled by trolls. But all of Yemotaferi feels the heart of the swamp calling out to us, and we must save it."

 S50_a_study_in_scarlet_title:0 "A Study in Scarlet"
 S50_a_study_in_scarlet_desc:0 "Dear Elder Warden,\n\nThe Deathsworn have a reputation as expert troll killers, and deservedly so. Even before all of Yemotaferi moved into the swamp, we regularly ventured forth to slay the trolls where they lived. We can learn even more now, with the aid of the scholars endeavouring to understand the swamp. Killing trolls will become a field of study, so that we may triumph over them like never before.\n\nYours faithfully,\nHlemi zor Yemane"

 S50_make_for_the_matriarch_desc:0 "When the swamp first cried out in our nightmares, we did not know the exact source. All we knew was we needed to act. By now, we have pieced together that it is the Shadowroot Matriarch, the grand tree at the centre of the swamp, that is sending us these dreams. And now that we are so close to liberating her, her cries are getting louder again."

 S50_cleansed_in_his_name_title:0 "Cleansed in His Name"
 S50_cleansed_in_his_name_desc:0 "Finally, we are here, standing before the being that called for us. Mistreated by the hags, the Yezelne Nisha is riddled with long nails, draining her power. It is no wonder her cries rang so loudly in our nightmares. Healing her will not be easy, as her pain makes her lash out, dropping figs that turn into shambling mounds and unleashing bursts of dark energy at any who approach. But this is not the time to shy away from danger; we will save her."

 S50_safeguard_the_ashhana_title:0 "Safeguard the Ashhana"
 S50_safeguard_the_ashhana_desc:0 "Dear Elder Warden,\n\nWe have successfully defeated the hags and destroyed the schemes they had designed for the future. But they had already lived long, dastardly lives by the time we started our campaign, and inflicted much harm already. The vilest of their works is undoubtedly the Ashhana Blood Curse, which damns an entire race of lizardfolk to a life filled with murderous rage. We should strive to undo this evil work. By my measure, the first step is to guard the Ashhana from other lizards, who resent them for what the hags made them.\n\nRespectfully,\nJishan zor Jenas"

 S50_packs_of_the_goddess_desc:0 "Gracious Chief of the Wardens,\n\nMy people share a long and often troubled history with the gnolls. We have often been serfs or slaves to them. Those of us who served the hag Coven have often used the power of such patrons to take revenge on the gnolls, and the bad blood persists into this age. It need not be like this. My people are more unified and peaceful than ever, and the gnolls of Haraagtseda serve neither demons nor hags. Rather, their goddess is one of rebirth and craftsmanship, a force for good just like your own Amilak. Bring them into the fold, so we can mend the rift between gnolls and humans.\n\nProudly yours,\nKricirr ‘the Strong’"

A pitch-black fig, unmistakably one of Mother Shadowroot’s fruits. An invitation from the shrine’s caretaker."

 S50_call_on_the_riyitewag_desc:0 "Dear Elder,\n\nWe are not the only people faced with the prospect of trollish invasion; they threaten all of Madriamilak. If we fall, our neighbours are next. We must make this abundantly clear to as many Mengi courts as we can; they must help us find the manpower required to hold fast. The many roaming bands of Riyitewag would be a great help, and the kings of Amilak's domain should help us wrangle them into service.\n\nYours faithfully,\nKebek zor Zelalem"

 S50_a_study_in_shadows_desc:0 "Dear Elder Warden,\n\nThe Shadow Swamp is unlike any other place and requires tactics unlike any other. We Deathsworn, who have always ventured into the swamp to hunt trolls, are the model soldiers for this campaign. But until now, our bands have mostly operated independently from Yemotaferi’s forces. It is time we became a formal part of the military. We shall formalise our training and leadership and make ourselves available to the nation.\n\nYours faithfully,\nHlemi zor Yemane"

I pride myself on being one of the first to understand the spiritual significance of Mother Shadowroot, and I am happy to see the nation following suit. I urge you to encourage the further veneration and study of the Shadowroot, as she is the heart of the swamp. More than any great tower or city, I believe she deserves to be our administrative centre as well.

They jot down the most mundane and frivolous things, hoping to glean some insight into our ancestral affliction. But listen to me, human, you need not devise a cure for us, for we already have it: art. If you wish to help us overcome the bloodlust, then help each and every one of us to become a great artist. Give us tools, give us materials, send us great bards and painters to learn from. That is the key to our salvation.\n\nGratitude and salutations,\nHassa Newsong"

Once our realms drowned in blood, now in paint. Once our lands were awash with the deathscreams and battle cries, now songs rend the air. My own mind has been clear for some time, but now that privilege has been extended to so many more of my kin. Our realm is growing rich, our lives are filled with joy. But do not think that we have grown weak, for a clear mind serves a warrior far better than a blood-fueled trance.\n\nGratitude and salutations,\nHassa Newsong"

One would be forgiven for believing they are unrepentant troublemakers, and some in the council certainly think so. I am not among them. I believe the leadership of Simegasa was rotten but not its people. They are our cherished kin, and we should make every effort we can to put them on the right path again.

Rain-Priests, Deathsworn, and scholars banded together to save the remnants of our realm. Through hard work and a humble attitude, this faction - known to the people as the Swamp Wardens - has saved Yemotaferi from ruin.\n\nStill, the labours are not yet at an end, the realm far from rebuilt. We must mend our broken bonds with the Tanizu, oppose the warmongering shadow-touched king of Simegasa, and rally fellow Mengi realms to stand against the trollish horde. The Swamp Wardens must form a true and stable government if Yemotaferi is to prosper. A council of our finest, representing the varying groups comprising the faction, shall take the lead under the guidance of an Elder Warden, who will serve as sovereign of our people."

Beyond the black treeline lurked the dark shadows of the swamp, but the gathering itself was illuminated by a number of torches, radiating white light.\n\nThe Deathsworn of Yemotaferi and the shapeshifters of the Violent Hearted Goose and Friend Helping Parrot tribes prepared to speak oaths that would bind them in a shared struggle against the Coven of Yezel Mora. From this day on, all would fight as one against the evil that plagued their homes.\n\nOne thing was not yet decided: the question of Tanizu command. The Yemotaferi captain nodded appreciatively at the leader of each of the tribes. But in the end, he would choose one to shake hands with, endorsing their leadership over all Tanizu."

Every devout servant of Amilak was to pack up every scrap of food, tool, and weapon they could carry, and join the great exodus into the Shadow Swamp. There, the entire nation of Yemotaferi would find a new home, bringing the light and love of Amilak into the damp and dark.\n\nAt first, the villagers were perturbed, scared to join in this endeavour, which seemed tantamount to suffering and death. But when a few brave youngsters loudly pledged themselves to the cause, a sense of duty and zeal spread through the assembled Mengi. Before long, the whole village was frantically gathering supplies, preparing for the journey."

Though we have seized the Shadowroot Matriarch from them, along with the heartlands of the trollish horde, the Coven still has resources and lackeys, which they are now calling on.\n\nAll around the swamp, in realms like Rakkaz, Rombeni, and Simegasa, shadow cultists are crawling out of the woodwork. A dark coalition is taking shape, and the hags are taking personal command of legions of trolls, gnolls, and humans. A tide of evil is about to come crashing down on us, threatening to undo our righteous efforts."
 yemotaferi.5.a:0 "To arms!"
 yemotaferi.6.t:0 "Shattered and Scattered"
 yemotaferi.6.d:0 "We've broken the Coven's legions, routed their lackeys, and destroyed any organised resistance. The Hags themselves have abandoned their cause, each seeking safety in her own way.\n\nHireet, together with a small elite warband, managed to break through our lines and disappear into the jungles of Taneyas\n\nKomina is said to have enthralled two of our Deathsworn and headed westward, but none of our squads managed to intercept her; unfortunately, it seems she is also lost to us.\n\nNevertheless, we still have a chance to break the Coven for good by slaying Granny Ilfanil. We've learned she intends to escape into the Shadow Plane through a rift torn into the darkness. Her captured acolytes claim she could open such gates at the flick of her hand in the past, but ever since we brought the light of Amilak into the Shadow Swamp, she has struggled to do so.\n\nIf these testimonies can be believed, we have her at a disadvantage. There are but a handful of truly black spots left in the swamp, and if we move fast, we can set up an ambush and take her by surprise."

From their towers, our cloud-mages have woven a web of light and protection, leaving only a handful of dark groves as an avenue of escape into the Shadow Plane, forcing Granny to take a path of our choosing. Along that route, our squads lie in ambush. Covered in mud, leaves, and illusions, we await the hag's approach.\n\nWe wait and wait in silence, lying still as corpses, rationing our breaths. We grip our weapons tight, taking care not to tremble. Surprise and unrelenting ferocity will guarantee our victory."

 yemotaferi.7.d:0 "One by one, we pulled the nails from Mother Shadowroot. We mended her mutilated trunk and branches meticulously, our great transmuters and botanists working in unison to heal the sap-leaking wounds inflicted by the hags. Over time, we felt her panic subside. Fewer and fewer figs dropped from her branches, and the flow of dark energies became less overwhelming. Soon, the swamp will be a little more hospitable.\n\nThis endeavour has proven what we already knew in our hearts, that the Shadowroot is a gentle soul, one who takes care of her swamp-children. The nails that once pained her, we will melt down and use to construct a shrine in honour of the Mother. From now on, our people will have two guardians watching over us."

Tied, so far."

 yemotaferi.9.t:0 "At Mother's Shrine"
 yemotaferi.9.d:0 "The Shrine to the Mother is the jewel in our crown. The jet-black nails that once pierced her body are now reforged into six thick pillars, holding up the hexagonal structure. Her roots have been tempted through transmutation magic to wrap around the metal, and various pieces of timber have been wrought into organic shapes to fill the gaps in the frame. A thick dome of Dao steel, courtesy of the guardians of Esuvrem, sits atop.\n\nCreating art in a world without colour is a challenge, but our most accomplished Ashhana artists have taken to it with glee. Mixing native and foreign dyes, they've painted the holy site in shades of grey and hues of gray, showing scenes from the swamp's ancient and recent history. The Rombeni archmage of Muhaqaar and the high priest of Cloudfall Tower have collaborated on a web of flickering flames, bathing the shrine in a constant dance of shadow and light.\n\nInside, there is an altar of pure white marble, hosting a collection of objects contributed by various pilgrims from across the League of Light. Statuettes of joyful crocodilians, carved in the jungles of Taneyas, stand next to scrap-relics from the Haraagtsedan league and clay figurines of Amilak. Pilgrims from all corners of the realm stream in and out, the Elder Warden in his grey robes filing in among them."

So close to the font of dark energy, you feel your mind slipping, hallucinations mix with reality, and deep in your bones you hear a far-off place calling for your soul. Walking away from that marvellous trance takes great strength of will. Many would be content to sleep forever under the Mother's canopy. More than once, wardens are dragged back against their will.\n\nThe magically inclined among us find themselves bursting with power after a visit to the Shadowroot Shrine. The touch of shadow often leaves its marks, turning a supplicant's eyes pitch-black or drawing a web of dark lines across their face. A fearsome guise to outsiders, but a mark of honour as far as we are concerned."

 yemotaferi.12.d:0 "From our swamp, the waterways run into Madriamilak, and the water fuels agriculture and trade for our fellow Mengi. But the rivers could be cleaner than they usually are. The death and decay that is so ubiquitous here affects the streams as well. Plants, carcasses, and soil infused with dark energies travel onto the shores of our kin downstream. Not only does it frighten them, but it also hurts the prosperity of the riverbanks. As caretakers of the Shadow Swamp, we have a duty to clean it all up.\n\nBy hand, magic, and prayer, we cleanse and bless the rivers, sending the water on its way to do good in the land of Amilak."
